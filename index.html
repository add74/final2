    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
           <p><em>1. Consider technology’s role in acts of making</em></p>
  <p>I truly did not comprehend the ways in which technonolgy is able to optimize all careers. Technology allows for a whole new relam of buisness to be opened. Through my short period of time in this course I have discovered the multitude of ways that technology can improve practices. I work for a nonprofit and we often use tools like canva to create flyers. Having th skills to use indesign or illustrator could prove ver helpful for future fundraisers and events.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
  <p>In our reading weve gone over a plethora of design principles. I had a very minimal understanding of UX Design. I learned the ux is much more complex than just simply design for multiple mediums. One of the points in the reading that piqued my interest was the idea that you will need to convince others that your design is the right design. Design is so objective that there is no right or wrong answer and in ux you must market yourself and your design. Lesson 10 sort of talks about the rules of UX. Its all about building an expertise and perfecting your craft. I also enjoyed learning that psychology plays a big role in designing ux (since I am a psych major). Design is a game to convince the consumer/client that what's on display is something they need or love. Appealing with pathos will create the most successful content.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3.Recognize and respond to ethical concerns.</em></p>
  <p>Weve addressed the fact that design can be stolen/ duplicated very easily. It is very simple to use the premade template designs on canva, but it feels unethical to change the color and pawn it off as your own design. Ethical design is complicated becuase so far most of the projects we have done in class duplicate other already made designs. If this were professional independent work i would struggle to cultivate design ideas on my own. I think inspiration plays a huge role in what designs get created.</p>

        <p><em>4. Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></p>
  <p>Workshops with fellow students have been extremely helpful. It is nice to soundboard ideas, hear their succeses, and their failures. Most times the issues i was running into were very relatable. I have been able to learn from my fellow classmates. Some of them are extremely tech savvy which has allowed me to learn new ways to do things through them. The beauty of technology is that there are a million ways to get from point A to point B.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>5. Practice revision within and across media forms</em></p>
  <p>Revisions are crucial to creating the perfect design. I used to assume i could make something once and be done with it, but when it comes to such intricate details revision is required.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
    <p><em>6. Learn to present your work</em></p>
<p>Our UX design was my first time creating a study my work. I was surprised about how insightful my participants were about my design. It was fun to create logos and then edit them- I actually liked the edited versions better than the original. My only limitation was the part of the assignment that required us to use zoom. Some of my participants didn’t have zoom prior so it was a bit of an inconvenience to download it. Then my iPad wouldn’t allow me to record the sessions so I had to restart them on my laptop. Once I hit record on my laptop and finished a whole session I wasn’t able to access that recording it disappeared into the stratosphere.I attempted to download some apps that transcribe audio recording s but they all required money. So I ended up having my participants give written responses along with me recording what they said. I wish I was able to figure out the zoom aspect, but I think it was more logical and convenient for me to get my participants written responses. Other than that hiccup everything else went well. Creating the PowerPoint was smooth and I like how I designed it.</p>

           <p><em>1. Consider technology’s role in acts of making</em></p>
  <p>For the majority of the assignments we use Abode creator. I am slowly but surely becoming more comfortbale with InDesign and Creator. I began to realize that many people dont have access to the adobe applications and are not fully comfortable using them. For my design consultation I had to use Canva because it was the most convientally accessible for them.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
  <p>I leveraged unconvential but functional design methods in most of these assignments. For the AD I abstractly collaged the images. For the design consultaion i played with colors that wouldnt normally flow together. The pink and blue in the trans flag arent conventially used in Fall themed advertisments. But i tried to keep symmetry and practicallity in the designs.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3.Recognize and respond to ethical concerns.</em></p>
  <p>The only ethical dillema i thought i may face is using Canva Premium for my design consultation. Since they have premade formatts i didnt want to become lazy in my design method. Fortunately that did not happen. The premium feature came in handy when it came to accessing certain additions. But i made my designs and background layouts from scratch.</p>

        <p><em>4. Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></p>
  <p>My classmates helped me appreciate my designs. Sometimes we can be so critical on our own work. I would always compare what ive made to others with more professional experience. My groupmates pointed out the genuisses in my designs and lightly critiqued what coukld make it better in their eyes.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>5. Practice revision within and across media forms</em></p>
  <p>I completey revised my two page spread. My original just felt slopy and unfinished. It was probably the most difficult assignment for me to work with. But I chose a different example to copy and tried my best to resemble it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
    <p><em>6. Learn to present your work</em></p>
<p>The design consultaion gave me more experience presenting my work. It was nice to have an actual clint who will benefit from my designs. The formal structure of the assignment gave me a template for professionalism if I choose to do future work with clients.</p>

       <p><em>1. Consider technology’s role in acts of making</em></p>
<p>Obviously Adobe played a large role in the creation of the spreads. I would say that things i found online inspired my final designs. </p>
    </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
    <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
<p> All of the assignments required me to think deeply about how inclusive my designs were. We discussed in class and found in our readings that inclusive design can be hard to come by. It is important to access how an audience recieves your creations. Through workshops and the UX design I was given insigful information about detailed aspects of my designs such as layout, color, and content.</p>
    </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
    <p><em>3.Recognize and respond to ethical concerns.</em></p>
<p>I used existing spread designs to inspire my final designs. There could be ethical concerns about the originality of the design. But in this world i believe all designs are built off of inspirations from another. Ethically this isnt a big issue for design.</p>

   <div class="container-fluid bg-w text-center">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-4">
    <p><em>4. Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></p>
<p>Like previously states workshops are instrumental in creating inclusive designs. In my cat food brand I had participants who were both cat owners and non cat owners to access the marketability of my prodcut to all consumers. Different people have different life experiences which offers different insight. When workshopping in class I recieved commentary that allowed me to look at my brand in a way i hadnt before.This resulted in me changing the name from PurE to PURRe!</p>
    </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
    <p><em>5. Practice revision within and across media forms</em></p>
<p>The main media form used throughout the course was Adobe. I created my spreads through adobe although it may have been easier and cleaner to create them through another forum like Canva. I sketched my original style for PURRe in both Adobe and Canvas platform to see which yeilded the best results. Doing more research into different media forms could be beneficial in the future to find the best design.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
<p><em>6. Learn to present your work</em></p>
<p>Through the UX designs we have completed in class i have fine tuned my ability to present my work. It is important to not use too much text on slides so that viewers can pay attention to what is being said. </p>
